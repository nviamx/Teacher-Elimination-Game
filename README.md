On Screen 5, thereâ€™s the game in which the character keeps randomly moving for 20 seconds and the player has to mash the character to score a point. The game also has a 20 second timer in which when done moves onto either screen 7 if the player has won and scored 18 or more within the time limit, or onto screen8 if the player lost the game.
